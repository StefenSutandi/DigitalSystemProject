# Finite Field Arithmetic Calculator on FPGA

In this project, I developed a simple calculator capable of performing arithmetic operations within a finite field using an FPGA (Cyclone IV). The design involved implementing efficient algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in a finite field.

I utilized Hardware Description Language (HDL) to create a robust and optimized design, which was subsequently synthesized and tested on the Cyclone IV FPGA platform. This project significantly enhanced my skills in digital design, FPGA programming, and finite field arithmetic, providing valuable hands-on experience in hardware implementation.


## Features

- **Addition**: Implements addition operations in a finite field.
- **Subtraction**: Implements subtraction operations with optimized algorithms.
